    <h1>Layer Four: Application Layer</h1>
        <p>We finally come to the last official layer in the TCP/IP model, the Application Layer. The application layer enables
        a networked device to access the network and applications, such as email. This is the layer that users interact with.
        You can think of it as the supermarkets or restaurants that are the frontend to the interstate system.</p>

            <h2>Sockets</h2>
            <article>
                As you are reading this, you must be wondering to yourself, what is a socket? You might already know if you read
                ahead. Sockets, better known as TCP sockets, enable connections between an application adn the TCP layer. Socket pairs
                are used by two applications to send data between each other. Ok...So, how are sockets created you ask.
                Both receiving and destination sockets are created in the same way. They are created with the IP of the device that is hosting the
                application along with the port number that the application is running on.

                <h3>Header Vulnerabilities</h3>
                <article id="header">
                    The application header is most prone to buffer overflow attacks. Buffer overflow occurs when an attacker
                    sends an amount of data that exceeds what the application expects to receive. Not everyone has the capbability
                    to mitigate buffer overflow attacks. Most of the mitigation techniques, including stack canaries require
                    that the developers of a given application be educated and aware of the vulnerabilities inside their application.
                </article>
                <h3>Protocol Vulnerabilities</h3>
                <article id="protocol">
                    Most protocol-based breaches affect the specific application under attack. However, if an adversary were
                    to breach an application while its being remotely accessed, the adversary could daisy chain off the application
                    into the computer of the remote user...and that's no good. Protocol attacks are designed by adversaries
                    to forego authentication mechanisms imposed by the application layer.
                </article>
                <h3>Authentication Vulnerabilities</h3>
                <article id="authentication">
                    The most common breaches against applications occur against an application's authentication methods.
                    There are two types of breaches, indirect breaches and direct breaches. Direct attacks occur when adversaries
                    use an application's authentication piece to attack the application. In-direct attacks occur when adversaries
                    use the application header, protocol, or traffic to the application to forego application authentication.
                </article>
                <h3>Traffic Vulnerabilities</h3>
                <article id="traffic">
                    At the application layer, the adversary's goal is to deny user access to any given application. The primary
                    strategy of adversaries to accomplish this goal is to utilize denial of service attacks.

                <h3>Other Vulnerabilities</h3>
                <h4>Session Hijacking</h4>
                <article>
                    We learned a bit about session hijacking in the TCP layer, however, how does it occur
                    in an application. Attackers perform session hijacking in the application layer by hijacking the session
                    between the user and web server. How does this happen? Browsers essentially maintain sessions using cookies to
                    keep users logged in without having to reauthenticate them time and time again, like online shoppers. Using
                    HTTPS, an encryption protocol, during your browsing time will aid in encrypting communications between your device (Client)
                    and the application's server.
                </article>
                <h4>Cookie Poisoning</h4>
                <article>
                    You've heard of cookies right...the pop up window that appears whenever you access a new website. What
                    happens if cookies has been poisoned? First off how does a cookie work? Cookies store user session information
                    so that if you were to ever leave a page and come back, any work that you did on the page wouldn't have been
                    lost. A cookie poisoning attack, attackers modify or steal the cookies to inject malicious data or
                    gain access to sensitive information. Web application firewalls are one of the remedies for this attack.
                    WAFs monitor HTTP sessions and will flag suspicious activity...essentially filtering the bad cookies
                    from reaching the application's server. Encrypted cookies is another remedy. Encrypted cookies can't be accessed
                    through JavaScript, a scripting language used by malicious actors.
                </article>
                <h4>Cross Site Scripting</h4>
                <article>
                    Cross site scripting occurs when attackers inject malicious code into an applications programming. Once a
                    user accesses the website's script, their device becomes infected with the attackers code. The attacker can
                    then launch scripts to heist the users personal information. There is no remedy for this style of attack on
                    the user's end, its all on the developer end to prevent these attacks.
