        <h1>History of the TCP/IP model and the OSI model</h1>
        <h2>Background of TCP/IP and OSI</h2>
        <article class="history">
            The creation of the TCP/IP model dates back to the 1970s. The development of the TCP/IP model was in response
            to the OSI model's failure to stay popular among vendors as well as OSI's comlex structure. According to RFC 793,
            TCP was designed to provide reliable and securable connections between pairs of processes and devices. IP, according
            to RFC 791, is designed for use in interconnected systems of packet-switched computer communication systems. IP
            has two basic functions, the addressing and fragmentation of packets. Before TCP/IP became commonplace, however,
            the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection Model) was used as previously mentioned.
        </article>
        <h2>What is the OSI Model?</h2>
        <article>
            The OSI model was the very first networking model. As aforementioned, it didn't take off in popularity, due to its
            complex size and scale. The OSI model also wasn't able to adapt to the multitude of vendor networking equipment
            The following are the layers of the OSI model...
        </article>
        <h3>Level One: Physical Layer</h3>
        <article class="l1">
            At the physical layer, packets and packet data are converted into strings of 1s and 0s. This layer is similar
            to how the physical layer in TCP operates and is also interacts with most of the same equipment as well.
        </article>
        <h3>Level Two: Data Link Layer</h3>
        <article class="l2">
            Similar to how the network layer in TCP operates, the data link layer also helps to facilitate data transfer between
            two devices using the same network. The data link layer is also responsible for flow control and error control, however
            this layer only manages these two flows when networks are communicating with each other.
        </article>
        <h3>Level Three: Network Layer</h3>
        <article class="l3">
            The Network Layer is like a branch off of the data link layer. This layer is responsible for facilitating transfer of
            data when two networks are communicating with each other. This layer also functions to determine the optimal physical
            path required to packets and their data to the end destination
        </article>
        <h3>Level Four: Transport Layer</h3>
        <article class="l4">
            The transport layer is responsible for handling end-to-end communication between devices that are interacting with
            each other. Within the transport layer, the segmented data from the session layer, is reassembled. To control errors,
            the transport layer also manages the flow of data and any necessary error messages that are sent in response to
            error events. In order to effectively control errors, the transport layer reviews data to ensure data transfer
            was done properly.
        </article>
        <h3>Level Five: Session Layer</h3>
        <article class="l5">
            The session layer handles the opening and closing of the communications between two devices. The term session
            refers to the time between opening and closing of the device interactions. The session layer is also responsible
            for synchronizing data transfers through the use of checkpoints.
        </article>
        <h3>Level Six: Presentation Layer</h3>
        <article class="l6">
            The presentation layer is responsible for preparing data for the application layer. The presentation prepares the
            data by translating its content into a form that the application layer can read.
        </article>
        <h3>Level Seven: Application Layer</h3>
        <article class="l7">
            The final layer, application layer, initiates communication between the user and applications that they
            personally interact with. Data is translated from its syntax into readable strings.
