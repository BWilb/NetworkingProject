    <h1>TCP/IP: Physical Layer</h1>
    <article>The first layer in the TCP/IP model is the Physical Layer. This layer is designed to provide physical connections
    to networks. In a highway or interstate system, you can think of the physical layer as the exit ramps, on ramps, and smaller
    roads that provide traffic a connection to the interstate system.</article>

            <h2>Physical Layer Vulnerabilities</h2>
            <h3>Protocol Based</h3>
            <article class="regular">
                If you're wondering, "is there any way to compromise Wired Ethernet at the protocol level?" If you're thinking yes,
                you're right...sort of. The protocol of Wired Ethernet is so incredibly simple and its implemented in the physical
                hardware of your or your victim's computer. There is one way to compromise wired ethernet, which is sabotaging the
                hardware controller...or breaking physical data lines, whichever sounds more fun to do. Wireless ethernet, you
                get to have more fun with. One method of attacking wireless ethernet is through war-driving. What is war-driving, you
                may ask.
            </article>
            <article>
                War-driving is the process of using a broad casted SSID to determine location and availability of
                access points. It's sort of like driving around the neighborhood and smashing mailboxes, except, instead of
                smashing mailboxes you're trying to compromise private and federal access points. If you were to war drive an
                area, the hardware tools that you would need are a mobile device, a wireless network card antenna and a GPS System.
                You'll also need some sort of software tool. <a href="https://wigle.net/">WiGLE</a>,
                <a href="https://www.openmoko.org/wiki/OpenBmap">OpenBmap</a>, and <a href="https://www.mapscripting.com/joining-the-geomena-project.html">Geomena</a> are some of the software
                that could be used. These three websites generate network maps in neighborhoods based upon data that are uploaded
                to these websites.
            </article>
            <article>
                How do you mitigate war-driving? You would want to secure your access points with the use of network access
                control. What is network access control? A network access controller is designed to ensure that only valid networked devices can access your
                network. NACs will be discussed later on in detail.<!--According to <a href="https://nordvpn.com/blog/what-is-wardriving/?msockid=23e2019cb9ab6afa2c021542b8ca6b54">NordVPN</a>
                you can also use multi-factor authentication, apart from a NAC. Despite how annoying TFA is, being able to weed out potential adversaries
                is a nice perk.-->
            </article>
            <h3>Authentication Based</h3>
            <article class="regular">
                In Wired Ethernet, one unique vulnerability is ARP poisoning. Now ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is an
                IP layer protocol, however the ARP protocol is used by your device to find the hardware address of other devices,
                based on the IP of those devices. So ARP poisoning is a vulnerability that can affect both the physical layer and the IP
                layer. More discussion over ARP poisoning will come in the network layer.
            </article>
            <article>
                Have you ever wanted to kick someone off their own domain (Network)? If so this next attack could be for you! An attacker
                can screw with their victim's ethernet hardware address domain, by setting their device's source address to the
                address of their victim's device. If you are the victim of one of these attacks, there really is no good mitigation
                to the problem, apart from purchasing a new device.
            </article>
            <h3>Traffic Based</h3>

            <article class="regular">
                In both the wired and wireless ethernet world there are two types of traffic based attacks, sniffing and flooding.
                <br>
                Have you ever seen videos on Youtube or other streaming services of Tsunamis making landfall and the wave of water
                wiping everything out in its path. Well with flooding, you're essentially doing the same thing, but with packets
                not water...even though flooding the victim's house could be a good attack strategy. An attacker essentially
                generates enormous amounts of broadcast traffic that it slows down the network and reduces the amount of non-spoofed
                traffic. This is also known as a Denial of Service or Distributed Denial of Service attack, depending upon how
                many devices are being used to flood the network. The good news is...there is no good news. There is no easy way
                to mitigate these types of attacks.
            </article>
            <article>
                (Insert sniffing noises here) mmmm your packet traffic smells delicious. At the physical layer, sniffing
                of un-secured and non-encrypted traffic can occur. In the upper layers, sniffing of packet traffic is more
                lucrative.
            </article>
            <h2>Remedies for vulnerabilities</h2>
            <h3>VLans</h3>
            <article class="regular" id="vlan">
                "What is VLan?", you may ask. VLan stands for Virtual Local Area Network, and this tool enables groups of networked devices
                to connect to the same network, regardless of location. How does a VLan work? Broken down by <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=581577">Dr. V. Rajaravivarma</a>,
                VLans function by logically segmenting any given network into different broadcast domains, so that packets are
                only switched between ports that are designated for the same VLan. Another way to explain what a VLAN does, is that VLANs
                segregate traffic into virtual networks so that only key users can view the specific traffic flows in those networks.
                A key component of any VLan, that can, by itself, serve itself as a remedy, is a switch. "filtering and forwarding
                decisions by packet, based on VLAN metrics defined by network managers, and to communicate this
                information to other switches and routers within the network" (Rajaravivarma, 50).
            </article>
            <h3>NAC</h3>
            <article class="regular" id="nac">
                As mentioned earlier NAC stands for network access controller. NACs ensure that only valid devices are allowed to
                access any given network. If a device is considered to be invalid or suspicious, NACs will either quarantine the device or
                limit the device to have so much computing resources. As laid out by Cisco, NACs have numerous capabilities, when it comes
                to rooting out suspicious devices. Two of a NACs capabilities will be discussed here. First off, profiling and visibility.
                Network access controllers have the ability to recognize and profile users and their devices before the user can
                become a potential threat. The other capability is guest networking access. With this capability, NACs are able to
                management guests through a self-service portal. This portal is customizable and is similar to a corporations intranetwork, including
                authentication of users, user registration, and user sponsoring.
            </article>
            <h3>Wired Equivalent Privacy</h3>
            <article class="regular">
                WEP or Wired Equivalent Privacy was the early version of Wi-Fi. This standard was developed in 1997,
                and its ultimate goal was to provide simple security and compliance with encryption export laws. How does WEP work?
                Between a wireless device and access point there is a shared secret key. This key is used to encrypt data frames.
                However, the authentication method of the wireless access point is weak and can't authenticate a user...the wireless
                device sends a message encrypted with WEP's shared key before sending an associated request. Sometimes these keys are
                used by all devices that communicate through WEP.
            </article>
            <h3>Wi-fi Protected Access</h3>
            <article class="regular">
                WPA or wifi protected access, was developed to operate in home environments. How does a WPA operate?
                Similar to how WEP works, wireless devices and access points still share a common password. This password, however,
                is not used as the encryption key, but the password used to authenticate user(s). Breaking the process down...the wireless device
                will associate with the access point and then send teh password as a one way hash. As a side note, a hash is the
                password itself, but the password has been formatted into a fixed string of numbers and letters.  Once the user/wireless device
                has been authenticated with the access point, a session encryption key is generated to be used for packet exchange
                between the wireless device and access point.
