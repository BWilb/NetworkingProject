            Every day, we interact with networks through electronic devices, whether it is during our everyday hustle and
            bustle to our quiet movie nights.
            How often, though, does one stop to think about how we are able to interact with these networks or how our
            electronic devices are
            able to share data with other devices?

            Each electronic device from smart toasters to the large servers of Twitter and Snapchat serves as a node on a
            series of networks. Before we break down the layers, a couple of vocab terms need to be discussed. There will be things
            called protocol, traffic, header, and authentication. Authentication is for authenticating two networked devices whether its
            user to user, host to host, or user to host. Traffic describes the packets that flow between two communicating
            devices or in the grander scheme all the packets on the network. Headers are what contain the control information for
            each packet. Protocol describes and defines how packets are supposed to operate and their scope.
            These networks are best represented by the TCP/IP model, which is broken down into four layers.

            The layers of the TCP/IP model are as follows...
