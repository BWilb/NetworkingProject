        <h1>Layer Three: Transport Layer</h1>

            <article>
                The third layer in the TCP/IP model is the Transport (TCP) Layer. So far we have the physical connection established
                by the physical layer and the digital signature created by the IP layer...so how do we transport data? Very good question
                and you're in luck, for the TCP layer is the layer that ensures reliable transfer of data and error control. Think
                of TCP as the semis and oil tankers that travel along the interstate.

            <h2>Multiplexing</h2>
            <article>
                MULTIPLEXING! Wow another new term (if you're new to networks). Multiplexing enables the TCP layer to support
                multiple applications at the same time. How does the TCP layer do this you may ask?...the answer is a unique
                id called a port. The TCP layer utilizes a port number and IP address to create a socket. In order for a packet
                to be sent to another networked device, both the receiving device and the sender device require a socket to
                be established on the TCP layer. Down below is an image that contains default port numbers readily available.

            <h2>Data Transfer</h2>
            <article>
                Unlike the lower layers, the TCP layer handles data far differently. The TCP layer utilizes what's called a
                stream-oriented service to the application layer. What does this stream-oriented service allow the TCP layer to do?
                This service enables the application that TCP has established a socket for to send data as a stream of bytes.

                There won't be a breakdown of the UDP packet, since its pretty simple to understand. Source port being the
                port being the application that is sending data, destination port the receiving application, total length being the
                total length of the UDP header, and checksum to maintain data integrity. Why was the UDP protocol designed?
                This protocol was designed to allow for an application to use TCP in a connectionless manner.

                How do these two packets operate? Starting off the DNS protocol is designed to use UDP, but it also supports
                TCP. To establish a connection to a DNS server, clients send a request, via a resolver, to a name server that's listening on port
                53. When the DNS server receives the request, it returns an answer to the client's resolver. When the resolver
                receives the answer it places the answer in a DNS cache for future use. What does the resolver need to know?
                The resolver needs to know the IP address, but not the hostname, of at least one DNS server. DNS servers can aid
                the resolver, through the maintaining of their own answer caches.

                <article id="tcp-header">
                    Within the TCP header, attacks can be broken down into two main sections. The first attack is disruption of
                    TCP layer implementation. How does an adversary do this? They accomplish this feat by feeding the TCP header
                    invalid information. The second type of attack is where the adversary strikes at your OS. This adversarys accomplish
                    through using responses to send invalid headers, which in turn reveals the type of OS of target machine.
                    This attack has a name; probing attack. Can you mitigate probing attacks...yes, but it'll be difficult,
                    since the attack uses the characteristics of the type of implementation of TCP done by the OS.

                <h3>Protocol Vulnerabilities</h3>
                <article id="tcp-protocol">
                    The TCP protocol is extremely vulnerable to attack, due to it being one of the most complex protocols. There are two
                    strategies used by attackers. One is endpoint strategy and the other is the sniffing strategy. One attack
                    under the endpoint strategy is sending packets out of sequence and disrupting the three way handshake.
                    However that style of attack isn't used as much as SYN flooding. What SYN flooding does is it essentially
                    forces servers to consume TCP resources during the TCP three way handshake. If the attacker can spam the servers
                    with enough packets, the servers will stop accepting new connections. With the second strategy, the attacker can
                    see traffic from client to server. One type of attack under this strategy is Session Hijacking. The ultimate goal
                    of the adversary is to steal the connection from either of the two parties to end up pretending to be the
                    stolen device.

                    DNS's protocol is very simple with its query and response. There is also no connection establish during
                    the query and response, so really the only thing an adversary can do is send false data to pretend to be a
                    DNS server.

                <h3>Authentication Vulnerabilities</h3>
                <article id="tcp-authentication">
                    TCP doesn't support authentication, since networked devices can't rely on port numbers to authenticate
                    application traffic.
                </article>
                <article id="UDP-authentication">
                    UDP has similar issues to that of TCP. UDP relies on ports and therefore can't authenticate application
                    traffic.
                </article>
                <article id="dns-authentication">
                    For the DNS authentication, there's a couple of attacks. The first attack is to send a bogus response to a client
                    query. The attack is designated for only a single device, however, the attacker would have to see the traffic
                    between the specific target and server. The other style of attack is where the attacker tricks the client
                    into connecting to the wrong IP address. The first strategy is to gain access to the DNS server and changing
                    internal tables holding teh name to IP address mapping. The second strategy is that the attacker sends corrupted
                    information to a server that has queried another server.
                    Mitigating these attacks would be difficult, since you'd have to change
                    the DNS protocol entirely.

                <article id="TCP-traffic">
                    Traffic wise, TCP is primarily vulnerable flooding based attacks, since TCP consumes enormous amounts
                    of computing resources. Sometimes, however, an adversary doesn't need to attack. Certain instances can cause
                    the TCP layer to become overwhelmed due to a rush of traffic to a popular application, i.e. website selling
                    Taylor Swift tickets.

                <article id="UDP-traffic">
                    Similar to any other packet type, UDP is subject to both sniffing and flooding. However, flooding attacks in
                    UDP are far less effective since UDP applications are typically slower to respond to a query.

                <article id="DNS-traffic">
                    Common attacks against DNS traffic is flooding the DNS server with requests. The DNS server, however,
                    is very simple and difficult to flood with requests. If UDP buffers fill up, DNS clients remain fairly
                    unaffected, since the client will retry sending a request several times if it doesn't receive a response
                    in a timely manner.

    <h2>Countermeasures to vulnerabilities</h2>
    <h3>Transport Layer Security (TLS)</h3>
    <article>
        What is TLS? TLS is a security tool designed to facilitate privacy and data security for communications over the internet.
        How is it used? It is used within the TCP layer (get it because we're discussing TCP) to encrypt communications between
        web applications and servers. Its design enables it to mitigate sniffing and host based authentication attacks. TLS
        also aids in authenticating the server and after authentication, help the server and client create an encryption key
        for encrypting traffic.
    </article>
    <h3>Other methods</h3>
    <article>
        Within TCP there is an attack called TCP blind Spoofing, where an attacker guesses both the port number and sequence
        number of an active session. If the attacker is successful, then they can send malicious packets into the ongoing session.
        This style of attack is dangerous, since the attacker can virtually go unnoticed, since the TCP layer doesn't throw up
        any red flags. To prevent this style of attack randomize the initial sequence number during port assignments.
